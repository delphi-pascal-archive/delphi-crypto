This archive contains six fast pseudo random number generators with
period lengths much greater than Pascal's random function: taus88 and
taus113 (Pierre L'Ecuyer), tt800 and mt19937 (Makoto Matsumoto et al,
mt19937 is the famous Mersenne Twister), kiss123 (George Marsaglia), and
xor4096 (Richard P. Brent). All are implemented with context records,
therefore several independent generators can be used simultaneously,
they are NOT cryptographically secure.

In addition there are three cryptographic generators:
 * Bob Jenkins' public domain ISAAC random number generator (Indirection,
   Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count). The average cycle length of ISAAC
   is 2**8295, the minimum length is 2**40.
 * salsar is based upon the Salsa20 stream cipher and needs the salsa20
   unit from salsa_yyyy-mm-dd.zip. The core routine uses 128 bit keys
   and 8 rounds (this default value can be changed to 12 or 20 rounds
   with salsar_set_rounds).
 * aesr uses the AES routines from aes_yyyy-mm-dd.zip in CTR mode with
   128 bit key.

The units and test programs can be compiled with all current Pascal
(TP5/5.5/6, BP7, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2) and Delphi (1..7/9/10/12) versions.
Most test programs need the ministat and/or the hrtimer unit.

Table of generator properties (C/B: CPU cycles per byte, MB/s: million
bytes per second on 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 / Windows 98, P7: Borland Pascal 7
real mode with 386 BASM; isaac was compiled with {$define testing}):
